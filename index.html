  <h1>Welcome to my personal web page</h1>
  <p>Here, you'll be in touch with my attempts of improving my knowledge in web development. Despite I'm Portuguese speaker, I am gonna write everything here in English, because I have been studying it as well. Below, you can see the piece of information about me:</p>
  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <h3>education</h3>
  <p>I'm a physicist from UNICAMP graduated in 2019, a master's student in Science and Mathematics Teaching at the same university. Since 2022, I've been studying a new undergraduate course in Computer Science.</p>
  <h3>professional experiences</h3>
  <p>I've been working since 2008, when I was 15 years old. In 2020, I began my career as physics teacher during 3 years. However, nowadays, I have been trying to shift my career to IT area, working with data, front-end and so on.</p>
  <h3>my main abilities</h3>
  <p>I have few knowledge in data science, AI and programming. But, I need to stay tuned more than usually I've been done. I mean, I need not only to study more but also narrowly. Then, this year, I decided to start learning front-end, specially with both TypeScript and Angular. I'm not totally confident about that, I'm just trying to know new ways to become a IT professional as soon as possible.</p>
